My first test Flutter project.

## Getting Started

This project is a starting point for a Flutter application.

It was made for studies propouses throgh this free course in [FreeCodeCamp](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VPvVD8t02U8)

A few resources to get you started if this is your first Flutter project:

- [Lab: Write your first Flutter app](https://docs.flutter.dev/get-started/codelab)
- [Cookbook: Useful Flutter samples](https://docs.flutter.dev/cookbook)

For help getting started with Flutter development, view the

samples, guidance on mobile development, and a full API reference.
